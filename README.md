### Sudoku is a logic-based, combinatorial number-placement puzzle. </br>
In classic Sudoku, the objective is to fill a 9 Ã— 9 grid with digits so that each contain all of the digits from 1 to 9.</br>
The puzzle setter provides a partially completed grid, which for a well-posed puzzle has a single solution<br>
The rules for soduko can be found here [https://www.sudokuonline.io/tips/sudoku-rules].

##### I have created a simple sodoku game where once grid is created with partially filled numbers. </br>
The goal is to fill out the grid.

#### Player may use keyboard to input the numbers and use mouse click to place the number in the grid. Player can also press C to clear a digit if entered wrong.
